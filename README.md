# TouchDroid
TouchDroid is an Android application that emulates input devices, specifically a touchpad and keyboard, to control a Windows computer via a local network. A desktop server application called TouchServer is required to be running on the Windows operating system in order to capture data sent by the application over the network and to register appropriate events to the host operating system.

An older version of the application is available through this repository and on the F-Droid repository.
